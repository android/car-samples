Car Samples Repository
==================

This repository contains a set of individual Android Studio projects to help you get started
writing apps for the car.

The samples are categorized by the libraries they use to integrate with the car:
- Car App Library - The library that allows developers to build navigation, parking,
and charging apps for the Android Auto-compatible cars. The app may be running in
a phone connected to the car or in the Android Automotive OS running in the car.
